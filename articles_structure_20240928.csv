mdl-39295862,https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-39295862,The immune response to Covid-19 mRNA vaccination among Lymphoma patients receiving anti-CD20 treatment.,"The monoclonal antibody rituximab improves clinical outcome in the treatment of CD20-positive lymphomatous neoplasms, and it is an established drug for treatment of these cancers. Successful mRNA COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination is extremely important for lymphoma patients because they tend to be elderly with comorbidities which leaves them at increased risk of poor outcomes once infected by Coronavirus. Anti-CD20 therapies such as rituximab, deplete B-cell populations and can affect vaccine efficacy. Therefore, a knowledge of the effect of COVID-19 vaccination in this group is critical. We followed a cohort of 28 patients with CD20-positive lymphomatous malignancies treated with rituximab that started prior to their course of COVID-19 vaccination, including boosters. We assayed for vaccine ""take"" in the humoral (IgG and IgA) and cellular compartment. Here, we show that short-term and long-term development of IgG and IgA antibodies directed toward COVID-19 spike protein are reduced in these patients compared to healthy controls. Conversely, the robustness and breath of underlying T-cell response is equal to healthy controls. This response is not limited to specific parts of the spike protein but spans the spike region, including response to the conserved Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). Our data informs on rational vaccine design and bodes well for future vaccination strategies that require strong induction of T-cell responses in these patients.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02
mdl-39314994,https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-39314994,Optimizing clinical outcomes: The journey of twins with CRIM-negative infantile-onset Pompe disease on high-dose enzyme replacement therapy and immunomodulation.,"Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). It is characterized by severe and progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness with death in the first 2 years of life if left untreated. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase-alfa is lifesaving, but its effectiveness is influenced by the patient's cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status, dose of ERT, and the development of high antibody titers, which can reduce the therapy's efficacy. The inability of CRIM-negative IOPD patients to produce native GAA exposes them to a high risk of development of anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers, leading to treatment failure. We present the case of CRIM-negative dizygotic twins treated with high-dose alglucosidase-alfa (40 mg/kg/week), initiated at 28 days (Twin A) and 44 days (Twin B). Both twins received immune tolerance induction (ITI) with rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG to mitigate antibody response. Initial evaluations revealed elevated left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and elevated biomarkers (urine glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc4), creatine kinase (CK), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) in both twins. Following treatment, cardiac function and biomarkers normalized within several months, with a slight delay in Twin B compared to Twin A, likely attributed to the later initiation of ERT. Both twins safely tolerated ITI, achieving immune tolerance with low antibody titers. At 28 months, the twins transitioned to avalglucosidase-alfa (40 mg/kg every other week (EOW)), which was well tolerated without an increase in antibody titers. At 39 months, both twins exhibited normal cardiac function, LVMI, and biomarkers. Motor skills continued to improve, though some kinematic concerns persisted. These cases underscore the importance of early, high-dose ERT combined with ITI in managing CRIM-negative IOPD. While transitioning to avalglucosidase-alfa at 40 mg/kg/EOW was beneficial and well-tolerated in our patients, further studies are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy compared to the high-dose weekly 40 mg/kg alglucosidase-alfa.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

Isolated longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) is a rare manifestation of WM. We report a rare case of paraneoplastic LETM in a 68-year-old male with treatment-naïve WM (MYD88 L265P mutation in bone marrow aspirate), who responded to ibrutinib and venetoclax therapy. Our patient presented with a two-month history of unsteadiness, tingling, and numbness in both hands and feet, that progressed to bilateral leg and arm weakness. Based on radiographic findings, a diagnosis of paraneoplastic LETM was made and he was treated acutely with IV methylprednisolone followed by a quick oral prednisone taper. However, he subsequently relapsed and symptomatically worsened while on rituximab therapy. Accounting for worsening anemia, our patient was enrolled in a Phase II trial evaluating the effects of ibrutinib-venetoclax therapy in treatment naïve WM. After three months of study therapy, he had a complete response of myelopathy symptoms and MRI lesions. Our observation of sustained disease response in this patient may support a role for concurrent BTK and BCL2 inhibition in paraneoplastic myelitis associated with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. However, this observation needs to be validated in larger cohort studies and potentially in clinical trials if further data are supportive.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

Initial laboratory values indicated septicemia. Differential diagnoses included Sweet's syndrome, septic emboli, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Punch biopsies and bacterial cultures confirmed disseminated methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection. Histopathology revealed intraepidermal vesiculopustules and bacterial cocci colonies in the superficial dermis, suggesting hematogenous spread. The patient's indwelling venous access port was identified as the infection source and removed. Treatment included antibiotics such as cefepime, vancomycin, fluconazole, and acyclovir, as well as filgrastim for neutropenia. Following port removal and a four-week course of ceftriaxone, the patient's condition improved. This case highlights the importance of clinicopathologic correlation in diagnosing and managing disseminated staphylococcal infections in immunocompromised patients. The rare presentation of vesiculopustular eruptions secondary to MSSA emphasizes the need for prompt identification and treatment to prevent severe complications. This report contributes to the limited literature on disseminated staphylococcal infections presenting as vesiculopustular eruptions in immunocompromised individuals.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02
mdl-39313873,https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-39313873,A Rare Presentation of Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis Associated with Primary Sjögren's Syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Sjögren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder that results in dry eyes and mouth. It is rarely associated with cryoglobulinemia, the agglutination of cryoglobulins at cold temperatures that leads to systemic inflammation and organ damage. We have, herein, presented a case of Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis (CryoVas), which presents as cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis and Central Nervous System (CNS) vasculitis and peripheral neuropathy. CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old woman with a past medical history of Sjögren's syndrome was admitted to the intensive care unit with severe hyponatremia, orthopnea, and progressive lower extremity weakness, and was found to have an intradural extramedullary hematoma with mass effect in the thoracic spine and diffuse hyperintense cord signal abnormality in thoracic spine suggestive of intermixed proteinaceous or hemorrhagic material. Further testing demonstrated that the patient experienced worsening neuropathy, proteinuria, hematuria, declining renal function, and the presence of cryoglobulins in the blood. After a thorough examination and a renal biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis of the spine. The patient was treated with rituximab and pulse-dose steroids, with which the patient exhibited improved renal function and resolution of a previously seen intradural hematoma on repeat MRI. CONCLUSION: We have, herein, discussed a rare case of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis that has led to a rare CNS manifestation and concomitant cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. This suggests that clinicians should consider cryoglobulinemic vasculitis as the etiology that could manifest with multiorgan involvement, especially in patients with underlying rheumatic diseases.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02
mdl-39313909,https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-39313909,Re-vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in allogeneic HSCT patients: Repeated primary vaccine doses increase seroconversion rates.,"Patients with haematological malignancies often exhibit reduced antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus vaccines, especially those who have undergone allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Limited data exist on vaccine efficacy in this group. In a retrospective analysis of 75 post-HSCT patients, we assessed serologic responses to one to four doses of Pfizer-BioNTech (PB), AstraZeneca (AZ) or Moderna (MU) vaccines within 2 years post-transplant. Seroconversion rates were 50.7%, 78%, 79% and 83% after the first to fourth doses respectively. The median time from allograft to first re-vaccination was 145 days (range 79-700). Failure to respond to the first vaccine dose was linked to acute GVHD (p = 0.042) and rituximab treatment within 12 months (p = 0.019). A trend was observed with chronic GVHD and seroconversion failure after the second (p = 0.07) and third (p = 0.09) doses. Patients vaccinated before HSCT showed better antibody responses post-transplant (p = 0.019). Coronavirus disease 2019 incidence was 16%, with 17% hospitalized and one death (8%). Despite low initial seroconversion rates post-HSCT, antibody responses improved after the second dose. Early full re-vaccination and boosters post-HSCT are recommended to reduce mortality. Rituximab use and active GVHD were identified as risk factors, warranting further investigation.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

In pediatric patients, symptoms usually start between 16 and 18 months of age; opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome presentation in children under 6 months is rare. Approximately 50% of cases are associated with neuroblastoma. We report an early onset presentation of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome in a previously healthy, 3-month-old female infant. The diagnostic workup revealed no abnormalities. The patient underwent monthly cycles of dexamethasone pulses and intravenous immunoglobulin with a favorable response. After a few months, the patient presented intermittent opsoclonus before the next scheduled pulse so from the 9th cycle onwards, the intravenous immunoglobulin dose was increased to 2 g/kg. After 9 months of treatment, she was diagnosed with a latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Due to this infection, dexamethasone pulses were discontinued, and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment was maintained with clinical improvement The patient received 18 intravenous immunoglobulin cycles, leaving her with a score of one on the Mitchell-Pike scale. Developmental milestones have been attained according to age. Despite the range of therapeutic options for managing opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome described in the literature, the efficacy of these available therapies needs to be better established. A modified upfront approach with dexamethasone and intravenous immunoglobulin could be an option in settings where rituximab is unavailable.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

mdl-39259430,https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-39259430,B-cell Depletion Therapy in Pediatric Neuroinflammatory Disease.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: B-cell depletion therapy, including anti-CD20 and anti-CD19 therapies, is increasingly used for a variety of autoimmune and conditions, including those affecting the central nervous system. However, B-cell depletion therapy use can be complicated by adverse effects associated with administration and immunosuppression. This review aims to summarize the application of anti-CD20 and anti-CD19 therapies for the pediatric neurologist and neuroimmunologist. RECENT FINDINGS: Most existing literature come from clinical trials with adult patients, although more recent studies are now capturing the effects of these therapies in children. The most common side effects include infusion related reactions and increased infection risk from immunosuppression. Several strategies can mitigate infusion related reactions. Increased infections due to persistent hypogammaglobulinemia can benefit from replacement immunoglobulin. B-cell depletion therapies can be safe and effective in pediatric patients. Anticipation and mitigation of common adverse effects through primary prevention strategies, close monitoring, and appropriate symptomatic management can improve safety and tolerability.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

The two current biosimilars available in dermatology in the United States (US) are infliximab and rituximab which were Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in 2016 and 2018 respectively. There has been significant interest in this topic as a number of biosimilar versions of adalimumab will be available in 2023. Objective: This review will discuss biosimilar basics and the experience with biosimilars used in dermatology in the US, Asia, and Europe. Methods: All articles in Ovid/Medline from 2015 to Feb 2023 on biosimilars were reviewed with a particular emphasis on medications used in dermatology. Other reports from pharmaceutical manufacturers and blogs following the development of the biosimilar industry provided key insights. Results: Biosimilars have been able to produce significant savings and market share increases, particularly in Europe, where there has been a longer experience. The specifics depend on drug prescribing practices and incentives in the individual country. This degree of savings and market share increases have not been realized with the current biosimilars available in the US. Conclusion: While biosimilars have resulted in significant savings compared to originator drugs, it is clear that prescribing incentives and physician education are crucial in achieving these savings. To what degree biosimilar market share will increase in the US remains to be determined.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

An additional cohort of patients with treatment-naive (TN) FL received only the acalabrutinib-rituximab combination. Acalabrutinib-rituximab was well tolerated and active in R/R and TN FL; in the TN cohort the overall response rate was 92.3% with most remissions lasting over 4 years.

Rituximab and other B-cell-depleting medications require screening of hepatitis B virus (HBV) serologies given the risk of HBV reactivation (HBVr). We aimed to describe the incidence and characteristics of passively transferred antiviral serologies from IVIG and how to differentiate between passive antibody transfer and resolved HBV infection. METHODS: This was a single-center descriptive study of neurology patients prescribed rituximab and IVIG. Retrospective medical record reviews were performed and patient-specific variables were collected. RESULTS: Twelve patients had reactive anti-HBc results after starting IVIG, but only 9 were confirmed to have reactive anti-HBc from passive transfer. Whether reactive anti-HBc in the remaining three patients was from passive IVIG transfer could not be confirmed. Five patients with reactive anti-HBc results during rituximab screening did not have pre-IVIG anti-HBc results for comparison and were started on antiviral prophylaxis. Reactive anti-HBc serologies changed to nonreactive after IVIG discontinuation 44-321 days after the last IVIG infusion. DISCUSSION: This study confirms IVIG can passively transfer anti-HBc serologies in a neurologic cohort. Ideally, HBV serologies would be checked before starting IVIG to help later determine if passive transfer occurred. With the increasing use of B-cell-depleting medications for neuromuscular conditions, it is important for providers to be knowledgeable on the interpretation of HBV serologies for patients on IVIG and to ensure implementation of an HBVr prophylaxis management strategy for patients when appropriate.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02
mdl-39267488,https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-39267488,Considerations for the use of biological therapies in elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,"INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that primarily affects middle-aged individuals but is increasingly prevalent among the elderly due to longer life expectancies. Treating elderly onset RA (EORA) is challenging for clinicians because of unique disease characteristics, comorbidities, polypharmacy, age-related physiological changes, and limited studies on the safety and efficacy of biological therapies in this population. This review aims to evaluate the use of various biological therapies in elderly RA patients. AREAS COVERED: This narrative review examines various aspects of RA in the elderly using published literature, randomized control trials, meta-analyses, and recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR). EXPERT OPINION: In EORA patients, the initiation of biological therapy is often delayed. Methotrexate remains the first-line treatment for both EORA and young onset RA (YORA). The combination of methotrexate and biological treatment shows comparable safety and efficacy in both EORA and YORA, except for rituximab, which is less effective in patients over 75. For elderly RA patients, biological (b-) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are preferred as the first advanced therapy over targeted synthetic (ts-) DMARDs due to their superior safety profile.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

We conducted a comprehensive search across multiple databases, identifying 81 studies, of which 11 met our inclusion criteria after rigorous screening and assessment for relevance and quality. Our analysis shows that rituximab, compared to traditional treatments such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine, significantly improves remission rates and reduces relapse frequency in GPA patients. Notably, rituximab's benefits extend across various patient demographics, including pediatric groups, and are evident in different dosing regimens, highlighting its versatility and potential as a first-line therapy. The review also underscores the importance of personalized medicine approaches in managing GPA, as rituximab's effectiveness was particularly pronounced in patients with relapsing disease forms. Future research should focus on long-term outcomes, optimal dosing strategies, and the economic implications of widespread rituximab use in clinical practice. Our findings advocate for the integration of rituximab into standard treatment protocols for GPA, offering new hope for patients afflicted with this challenging autoimmune disorder.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02
mdl-39280452,https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-39280452,Female With Hypertensive Emergency Later Found to Have ANCA-Associated Vasculitis: A Case Report.,"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a form of ANCA-associated vasculitis characterized by necrotizing vasculitis affecting small blood vessels. The clinical presentation varies based on organ involvement, commonly affecting the upper and lower respiratory tracts and kidneys. Typical GPA presents as recurrent sinus infection, otitis media, dyspnea, chest pain, and glomerulonephritis, which can present as hematuria, proteinuria, and elevated serum creatinine. ANCA tests positive in the majority of cases. Treatment strategies involve induction of remission and maintenance therapy. We report a case of a 48-year-old female presenting with a hypertensive emergency, a rarely reported manifestation of GPA. She initially presented with severe headache and cough, with systolic blood pressure exceeding 220 mmHg, necessitating hospital admission. The initial workup revealed elevated serum creatinine and CT chest findings suggestive of multi-lobar pneumonia, for which she received antibiotic treatment. Despite aggressive antihypertensive therapy, her blood pressure remained refractory, and she developed hematuria and anemia, requiring a blood transfusion. Further evaluation revealed a history of joint pain, recurrent sinus infections, and a pruritic skin rash, prompting suspicion of vasculitis. Further work-up included elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), normal IgE, absence of eosinophilia, and positive PR3 antibodies and c-ANCA. Prompted by clinical suspicion, treatment with steroids was initiated, and a kidney biopsy confirmed acute necrotizing pauci-immune glomerulonephritis consistent with GPA. Subsequently, rituximab therapy was initiated, resulting in significant improvement in her clinical symptoms and blood pressure, and the patient was successfully discharged home. This case highlights a rare presentation of GPA as a hypertensive emergency, possibly linked to renal involvement in the form of glomerulonephritis. Pulmonary manifestations mimicking infections posed diagnostic challenges. Cutaneous findings potentially associated with increased joint and renal involvement underscore the clinical complexity of GPA. The unusual presentation of hypertensive emergency in young patients underscores the need for heightened awareness of this potential manifestation in GPA. Early recognition and aggressive immunosuppressive therapy are crucial to mitigate irreversible renal damage in such atypical presentations.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

Our main objective was to analyze confirmed disability progression (CDP) in a cohort of patients with PPMS treated with anti-CD20 therapies compared with a weighted untreated control cohort. METHODS: This was a retrospective study using data from the French MS registry (Observatoire Français de la Sclérose En Plaques). We included patients with PPMS treated or never treated with anti-CD20 therapies from 2016 to 2021, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of ≤6.5 at baseline. The primary outcome was time to first CDP. The secondary outcomes were time to first relapse, MRI activity at 2 years, identification of risk factors associated with CDP, and serious infection incidence rates (IIRs). Each outcome was studied using an inverse probability of treatment weighting method. The outcomes were modeled using a weighted proportional Cox model for the time-to-event outcomes and by a logistic regression regarding the MRI activity. RESULTS: A total of 1,184 patients (426 treated and 758 untreated) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Median age (Q1-Q3) was 56 years (49.3-63.8), and 52.7% were female. Among treated patients, 295 received rituximab, whereas 131 received ocrelizumab. At baseline, anti-CD20-treated patients were younger (median 51.9 vs 58.6 years, Cohen d = 0.683) and had more active disease (54.5 vs 27.8%, Cohen d = 0.562). 91.6% were drug-naive at inclusion. In time to first CDP analysis, no statistical significance was observed (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% CI 0.93-1.36, p = 0.2113). In time to first relapse analysis, a nonsignificant trend toward fewer patients relapsing in the treated group was observed (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.48-1.28, p = 0.0809). For MRI activity, no significant difference was found between the 2 groups. Risk factors associated with CDP in the treated group were male sex and MS duration. IIR was 6.67 (95% CI 3.12-14.25) per 100 person-years in the treated group vs 2.67 (95% CI 0.80-8.86) in the untreated group. DISCUSSION: Time to first CDP was not different between anti-CD20 treated and untreated patients with PPMS. Although our study is retrospective and mainly included patients treated by rituximab, our results indicate that there should be a constant evaluation of all available data to ascertain the best risk/benefit ratio for patients with PPMS. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that anti-CD20 therapy of previously untreated patients with PPMS was not superior to no therapy in delaying time to first CDP.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

We characterized outcomes in a large cohort of GI-DLBCL patients treated with ST alone or CMT. Methods: Patients with GI-DLBCL treated at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models estimated survival. Multivariable analyses were conducted using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Of 204 patients, gastric involvement was most common (63%). Most presented with early-stage disease (61%). All patients received ST and 65 patients (32%) received RT, 88% as part of first-line CMT. Median dose was 36 Gy (IQR 30.6-39.6) in 18 fractions (IQR 17-22). Median follow-up was 46 months. Five-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was 88% and 84%, respectively; complete response (CR) rate was 82%. Improved OS associated with low IPI (p=0.001), fewer chemotherapy lines (p<0.001), early stage (p<0.006), and CR (p<0.001). Survival did not differ by RT receipt (p>0.25). Only early stage and CR correlated with improved OS on multivariable analysis. Stomach-directed RT vs. RT to other sites correlated with improved PFS and OS (p<0.04). Patients with early stage DLBCL treated with CMT in the post-rituximab era had equivalent OS vs. ST alone, even with fewer chemotherapy cycles (p<0.02; median of 4 with RT vs. 6 cycles without). Fifty patients had bulky disease (≥7.5 cm), of whom 18 (36%) had early stage disease. Among patients with bulky disease, 5 (10%) developed relapse at the initial site of disease bulk. Four of the 5 patients did not receive consolidative radiation. Among these 4 patients, 3 relapsed only in their initial site of bulky disease. Of 191 patients with luminal GI-DLBCL, n=4 (2.1%) developed perforation; only one received RT. Acute Grade 3 toxicities were reported in 41.2% of patients, and 12 (5.8%) patients had late Grade 3 toxicities, 99% attributed to chemotherapy. Conclusion: GI-DLBCL patients have favorable outcomes after CMT with minimal late toxicity. CMT may be offered with abridged systemic regimens with equivalent outcomes. Stomach directed-RT may mitigate relapse risk associated with incomplete disease response or bulky disease.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

There is a significant proportion of these patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) who are at risk of mortality and morbidity. There are limited available tools to assess the severity of parenchymal lung involvement and are subject to confounding factors, including the presence of pulmonary hypertension and concomitant smoking history. The diagnostic tools include careful clinical history, examination, thoracic imaging, and pulmonary function tests. One of the limitations of assessing disease severity in SSc-ILD is the lack of standardized definitions for disease activity and serum biomarkers to predict future progression. Although there has been significant progress in managing SSc-related ILD over the last couple of decades with a few randomized double-blind clinical trials assessing the role of immunosuppression (mainly Cyclophosphamide and Mycophenolate Mofetil), the efficacy of these therapies is at best modest and is associated with significant toxicities. Furthermore, Nintedanib has shown promise in reducing forced vital capacity decline in SSc-ILD and in progressive fibrotic-ILD of a range of etiologies. Data are emerging for therapies like Rituximab and Tocilizumab, and we are likely to see further evidence of similar drugs being efficacious in this disease cohort. A relatively simplified algorithm is proposed in this review to guide clinicians dealing with ILD and SSc. It is imperative that clinicians take a multi-disciplinary approach to managing this complex disease in a changing therapeutic landscape.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02
mdl-39318924,https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-39318924,Prognostic Factors for Mortality in Patients With Autoimmune Diseases Complicated by Pneumocystis Pneumonia.,"Objectives Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) has a poor prognosis in patients with autoimmune diseases. Additionally, the mortality of PCP in autoimmune diseases is higher than that of human immunodeficiency virus-PCP. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the risk factors associated with mortality in patients with autoimmune diseases complicated with PCP. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational study involving 38 patients treated for PCP at Showa University School of Medicine from January 2010 to August 2014. Diagnoses were established based on clinical symptoms, imaging, and laboratory tests, including hypoxemia (partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) < 70 mmHg), chest computed tomography findings, elevated (1,3)-ß-D-glucan, and positive Pneumocystis jiroveciipolymerase chain reaction tests from sputum samples. Data regarding patient demographics, underlying diseases, therapeutic interventions, and laboratory findings were collected. Statistical comparisons between survivors and non-survivors were performed using Fisher's exact probability test and Mann-Whitney U test for independence test with Stata/SE version 17.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX). Results The median age of the study group was 72.4 years old, with the majority having rheumatoid arthritis. Mortality occurred in 18% (seven out of 38) of cases. Factors associated with increased mortality include males, higher serum creatinine and C-reactive protein levels, lower albumin and immunoglobulin A levels, and lower PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio. No significant difference was observed in the rate of intratracheal intubation, ICU management, and hospitalization period. Prophylactic administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was not performed in any of the cases. Conclusions This study examined the risk of mortality for PCP in patients with autoimmune diseases. The male gender, low IgA and albumin levels, low PaO2/FiO2 ratio, as well as high creatinine and CRP levels, were identified as significant factors for poor prognosis. These factors can help identify patients at high risk for PCP and guide the consideration of prophylactic TMP-SMX administration. They may also provide insights into when to discontinue prophylactic treatment. Future studies should investigate the administration of prophylactic TMP-SMX. Additionally, the risk of mortality for PCP under the administration of new biological agents, such as anifrolumab, belimumab, and rituximab, or immunosuppressants, such as mycophenolate mofetil and voclosporin, should be evaluated. These findings can contribute to improving PCP prevention and treatment strategies in patients with autoimmune diseases, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

Patients received acalabrutinib from cycle 1 until disease progression or treatment discontinuation, bendamustine on days 1 and 2 of each cycle for up to 6 cycles, and rituximab on day 1 of each cycle for 6 cycles, continuing every other cycle from cycle 8 for 12 additional doses (TN cohort). Eighteen patients enrolled in the TN and 20 in the R/R cohort. Median duration of exposure to acalabrutinib was 34.0 and 14.6 months in the TN and R/R cohorts, respectively. No new safety risks were identified, and most adverse events (AEs) were grades 1 or 2. Thirteen patients from the TN cohort (72.2%) and 17 patients from the R/R cohort (85.0%) reported grade 3-4 AEs, most commonly neutropenia (TN: 38.9%, R/R: 50.0%). AEs leading to death were pneumonitis (n=1, TN cohort), COVID-19, and cerebrospinal meningitis (n=1 each, R/R cohort). Overall response was 94.4% and 85.0% in the TN and R/R cohorts, respectively; complete response rates were 77.8% and 70.0%, respectively. After a median follow-up of 47.6 months, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were not reached in the TN cohort. After a median follow-up of 20.4 months, median PFS was 28.6 months and OS was not reached in the R/R cohort.

However, the reproducibility of clinical trial results in routine clinical practice is unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we reviewed our experience with patients diagnosed with R/R follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) treated with this combination. Eighty-four patients underwent treatment with R-len, 69 (82%) affected by FL and 15 (18%) by MZL. The median age at the time of treatment initiation was 65 years (range, 39-94), 38 patients (45%) had a pre-treatment FLIPI score of 3-5, 19 (23%) had a bulky disease, 29 (37%) had a lymphoma refractory to the last treatment line, while in 20 (24%) cases the disease was refractory to rituximab. The best overall response rate (ORR) was 82%, and 52% achieved a complete response (CR). The best CR rates for FL and MZL patients were 55% and 40%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 22 months, the median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 22 months (95% CI 19-36) and the 2-year overall survival (OS) was 83% (95% CI 74-93). The median duration of CR (DoCR) was 46 months (95% CI 22-NR). Factors associated with shorter PFS in multivariate analysis were bulky disease and rituximab refractoriness. The most common adverse events (AE) included hematologic toxicity, fatigue and gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea and constipation. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were the most common severe toxicities (grade ≥3 in 25% and 4%, respectively). No new safety signals were reported. Real-life results of R-len in patients with R/R iNHL appear consistent with those reported in prospective studies, and further support its use as comparator arm in controlled clinical trials.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

Patients and methods Patients with indolent NHL treated with frontline BR therapy in Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, from January 2015 to August 2018 were included in this retrospective study. Results Our cohort included 42 adults with a median age of 63 years. Follicular lymphoma was the most common histology (n = 31, 74%). Most patients had advanced disease (Lugano stage III or IV, 88%). The overall response rate was 84% (complete response = 62% and partial response = 22%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached. At 30 months, PFS was 74.8% and overall survival was 90%. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 21% of patients. Infection-related adverse events were observed in 17 patients (40%). Most were grade 1 and 2 events (84%). One case of grade 5 progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy related to John Cunningham (JC) virus reactivation was observed. The most common non-infectious-related adverse events were mild nausea and fatigue. Conclusions The efficacy and safety of BR treatment for indolent NHL were comparable in our real-life cohort compared to prior studies. This supports BR as a standard of care for indolent NHL. Future studies should assess whether the use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors as primary prophylaxis effectively mitigates the hematological and infection-related adverse events related to BR therapy.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

The association of AMR with donor-specific antibodies (DSA), and its clinical course in relation to pathologic findings and treatment are ill defined. We identified cases of liver AMR by following the criteria outlined by the 2016 Banff Working Group. Patient demographics, native liver disease, histopathologic findings, treatment type, clinical outcome, and transaminase levels during AMR diagnosis, treatment, and resolution were determined. Patients (n = 8) with AMR average age was 55.2 years (range: 19-68). Seven of eight cases met the Banff criteria for AMR. Personalized treatment regimens consisted of optimization of immunosuppression, intravenous pulse steroids, plasmapheresis, IVIG, rituximab, and bortezomib. Five patients experienced complete resolution of AMR, return of transaminases to baseline, and decreased DSA at long-term follow-up. One patient developed chronic AMR and two patients required re-transplantation. Follow-up after AMR diagnosis ranged from one to 11 years. Because AMR can present at any time, crossmatch, early biopsy, and routine monitoring of DSA levels should be implemented following transaminase elevation to recognize AMR. Furthermore, treatment should be immediately implemented to reverse AMR and prevent graft failure, chronic damage, re-transplantation, and possibly mortality.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02
mdl-39221403,https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-39221403,Unusual Presentation of Aggressive Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome With Brugada Syndrome.,"Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is part of a spectrum of disorders known as thrombotic microangiopathies. These disorders are characterized by giving rise to platelet microthrombi, which subsequently develop hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. In HUS, the kidneys are destroyed, mainly due to damage to the renal blood vessels. HUS can be typical or atypical, depending on the cause, and can lead to significant mortality rates. We herein report an unusual case of atypical HUS in a 15-year-old female who presented with fatigue, abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, and urine discoloration. Further tests showed low platelets with significant anemia. She was diagnosed with atypical HUS after discovering that she had no previous bloody diarrhea episode with a negative E. coli strain, O157:H7, alongside valid ADAMTS13 activity. The diagnosis was confirmed by genetic testing, and a variant of uncertain significance was found in the CFH gene. The patient, therefore, was started on eculizumab, and a follow-up was done once or twice a month through blood testing. She showed significant improvement. Due to non-compliance with the eculizumab treatment, the patient showed deterioration numerous times. A kidney biopsy was subsequently done, showing signs of acute to chronic thrombotic microangiopathy with moderate tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. After many hemodialysis and plasma exchange sessions and being put on several treatments, such as prednisolone and rituximab, the patient faced death after one year.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02
mdl-39236292,https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-39236292,Incorporation of immunotherapy into frontline treatment for adults with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Although complete remission rates in adults with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) have improved over the last two decades, it is still inferior to that of the pediatric population and once in remission, the risk of relapse is still high. Furthermore, while pediatric-inspired chemotherapy regimens have improved long-term outcomes for adolescents and young adults, these intensive chemotherapy regimens are not well tolerated in older patients and are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Immunotherapeutic agents offer a potential opportunity to improve response and decrease relapse without increasing toxicity. The incorporation of rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) into chemotherapy regimens has been shown to improve outcomes. The treatment of BCP-ALL in adults has been transformed with the approval of inotuzumab ozogamicin (anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate), blinatumomab (CD3/CD19 bispecific antibody construct), and CAR T-cells for relapsed or refractory disease, and of blinatumomab for measurable residual disease (MRD)-positive remission. More recently, studies of inotuzumab and blinatumomab have shown promising results when used upfront either with or without multiagent chemotherapy. Blinatumomab has also been shown in a randomized trial to provide a survival benefit in patients with MRD-negative first remission when added to chemotherapy which recently led to its additional FDA approval for use in consolidation. In this review, we highlight the evolution of chemoimmunotherapy-based treatment approaches in the management of treatment-naïve BCP-ALL.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

While immunotherapies utilized in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder have shown varying efficacy in MOGAD, intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) recently emerged as a promising treatment. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, has been reported to be effective in refractory MOGAD in several case studies, where tocilizumab was introduced primarily due to rituximab failure. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in a single center and focused on MOGAD patients receiving tocilizumab therapy, who have shown limited response to various immunotherapies, including intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) maintenance. RESULTS: This study included four patients, three adults, and one child. They experienced a median of 9 attacks (range 6-9) throughout their disease course despite at least two immunotherapies. All patients transitioned to tocilizumab after experiencing a median of two relapses (range 1-3) while on IVIG maintenance for a median of 21.9 months (range 21.3-49.6 months). Following the monthly tocilizumab administration at a dose of 8g/kg, all patients remained relapse-free with a median follow-up duration of 25.0 months (range 9.8-51.3 months) without reported adverse events. CONCLUSION: Targeting the IL-6 pathway appears to offer therapeutic benefits in highly relapsing MOGAD patients who poorly respond to IVIG maintenance therapy.","","",ELEA,Argentina,NOVEX,2024-09-02

This analysis estimated the per-member-per-month (PMPM) costs of introducing dostarlimab + CP as a treatment alternative from a third-party US payer perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A budget impact model was developed to estimate the costs of introducing dostarlimab + CP into commercial and Medicare health plans over a 3-year time horizon (2023-2025). Costs were sourced from relevant literature and US-specific databases and were calculated using epidemiology data, clinical inputs, treatment costs, and market share estimates. Clinical inputs were sourced from primary clinical trials for each respective treatment (i.e. dostarlimab + CP, CP, pembrolizumab, pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib, bevacizumab + CP, and pembrolizumab + CP). Current and future market shares assumed dostarlimab + CP reduced the market share of CP only. Analyses were performed in mismatch repair-deficient/microsatellite instability-high (dMMR/MSI-H) and overall populations using a US 2023 cost year. RESULTS: For a commercial plan, the model estimated (dMMR/MSI-H and overall populations) that 7 and 26 patients would be treated with dostarlimab + CP, respectively; average annual budget impacts per patient treated were $118,257 and $116,094; average budget impacts per patient treated per month (PPPM) were $9,855 and $9,675; average budget impacts PMPM were $0.02 and $0.06. For a Medicare plan, the model estimated that 28 and 93 patients, respectively, would be treated with dostarlimab + CP. Average annual budget impacts per patient treated and PPPM were the same as those for the commercial plan in both populations; average budget impacts PMPM were $0.07 and $0.22, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Introducing dostarlimab + CP as a first-line treatment for patients with pA/rEC results in minimal budget impact PMPM from a US third-party payer's perspective. Together with the efficacy and safety results from RUBY, these results support the use of dostarlimab + CP as a treatment option.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

In contrast to other cancers, both incidence and mortality rates continue to rise, and HCC is now the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment landscape for advanced HCC, with trials demonstrating a superior overall survival benefit compared to sorafenib in the first-line setting. Combination therapy with either atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) and bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) or durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) and tremelimumab (anti-CTLA-4) is now recognised as standard of care for advanced HCC. More recently, two phase III studies of ICI-based combination therapy in the early and intermediate disease settings have successfully met their primary end points of improved recurrence- and progression-free survival, respectively. Despite these advances, and in contrast to other tumour types, there remain no validated predictive biomarkers of response to ICIs in HCC. Ongoing research efforts are focused on further characterising the tumour microenvironment in order to select patients most likely to benefit from ICI and identify novel therapeutic targets. Herein, we review the current understanding of the immune landscape in which HCC develops and the evidence for ICI-based therapeutic strategies in HCC. Additionally, we describe the state of biomarker development and novel immunotherapy approaches in HCC which have progressed beyond the pre-clinical stage and into early-phase trials.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

However, this method is cumbersome. We assessed urine screenings in gynecologic cancer patients from February 2021 to May 2022. Along with a simple urine dipstick (UD), the urine microalbumin, total protein, and creatinine were measured and calculated as the urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) and the urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR), which were further adjusted through the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equations to be estimated and correlated with 24-h urine total protein content. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was used for cost analysis. There were 129 urine samples from 36 patients. The sensitivity and specificity for the UACR were 0.56 and 0.97, and for the UPCR, 0.71 and 0.88, respectively. The 24-h TP correlated strongly with the UACR (r = 0.75; p < 0.001) and UPCR (r = 0.79; p < 0.001) and fair for the simple UD (r = 0.35; p < 0.001).

mdl-39260431,https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-39260431,A case report of successful combined intra-arterial immunotherapy and cytokine genetic therapy treatment in a patient with recurrent glioblastoma.,"BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor with very poor prognosis due to frequent recurrence and short overall survival (OS) time, which according to different sources, is not longer than 17 months after the diagnosis. Infiltrative growth pattern often leads to tumor propagation into functionally significant brain areas while surgery is cytoreductive and does not necessarily alter the prognosis. Many patients are in the working age, thus finding conservative approaches to the treatment of this type of neoplasms is of utmost importance. The aim of the work is to demonstrate the effectiveness of treatment of GBM using cytokine genetic therapy (CGT) and present an algorithm for patient management. CASE DESCRIPTION: This paper describes the first case of successful intra-arterial (IA) bevacizumab therapy with following CGT of a 46-year-old patient with recurrent GBM after a combined treatment. Sixteen courses of 15 mg/kg IA bevacizumab with hyperosmolar opening of blood-brain barrier (BBB) resulted in stabilization of the neoplastic process. After that, 9 courses of CGT with recombinant interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-thymosin α1 were performed. Both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast and positron emission tomography (PET) confirmed a complete response to the combined treatment. OS time is currently more than 25 months from the diagnosis. The observation continues. CONCLUSIONS: This case study expands the range of treatment options for GBM, especially in the context of intolerance and high toxicity of cytostatic drugs, and may lead to improved recurrence-free survival (RFS).","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

In this context, we aimed to comparatively analyze the therapeutic effects of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (D2), 1a, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3), bevacizumab and radiotherapy (RT) in a uveal melanoma cell line (MP41). Cytotoxicity was evaluated using XTT cell proliferation kit and Xcelligence cell analyzer system. RT dose was determined after a clonogenic assay. Annexin V/PI staining and Western blot analyses for caspase-3, -8, and -9 were performed to analyze apoptosis. Additionally, cell cycle analyses were also conducted. As a result, we found that D2 and D3 did not show cytotoxic effects, while bevacizumab and RT showed time and dose-dependent cytotoxicity. IC50 concentration of bevacizumab was 6.945 mg/mL. Radiotherapy and bevacizumab significantly reduced cell survival and induced apoptosis when administered both as monotherapy and in combination. A significant increase in caspase proteins was detected at high bevacizumab concentrations. However, the combination of bevacizumab and radiotherapy caused a substantial decrease in caspase-3, -8 and -9 expressions. No significant difference in cell cycle distribution was detected in any treatment. Our results showed that bevacizumab inhibited MP41 cell proliferation and had an additive effect when administered with RT. In conclusion, our study offers a different perspective on the treatment of uveal melanoma, and these results, when supported by animal experiments and clinical studies in the future, might be a new step in the treatment of this challenging ocular tumor.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

However, combination therapy is typically interrupted or discontinued owing to BEV-related adverse events. In this study, we examined the effects of BEV dose-reduction on the treatment of unresectable HCC using propensity score matching (PSM). METHOD: Overall, 119 patients with HCC who were treated with ATZ + BEV between November 2020 and October 2022 were enrolled retrospectively at our institute. The therapeutic effects and safety of BEV dose-reduction and non-dose reduction after PSM were compared. Decision-tree analysis was used to investigate treatment duration in the patients. RESULTS: Significant differences were not observed between the two groups after PSM. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) assessed by modified RECIST did not differ significantly between the two groups (BEV non-dose-reduction/dose-reduction: ORR; 46/34%, DCR; 80/91%). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) also did not differ significantly between the two groups (BEV non-dose-reduction /dose-reduction: PFS; 5.6/8.6 months, OS; 18.6/15.5 months). The median duration of treatment in the BEV dose-reduction group was significantly longer than that in the non-dose-reduction group (BEV non-dose-reduction /dose-reduction: 4.8/9.1 months, P = 0.038). Decision-tree analysis revealed that dose-reduction of BEV was the first distinguishae factor for the extension of treatment duration with ATZ + BEV. CONCLUSION: BEV dose-reduction can be effectively used in maintaining the treatment duration of ATZ + BEV while maintaining therapeutic effects and safety in real-world clinical practice.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

Previously we reported that immunological changes after Atezo/Bev administration for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) revealed significant alterations in interleukin (IL)-6, soluble IL-2 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and programmed cell death-1 levels. Among these variable factors, serum levels of IL-6 can be easily measured on a commercial baias. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the utility of serum IL-6 as a predictor of tumor response to Atezo/Bev treatment for uHCC. METHODS: The study included 44 patients with HCC treated with Atezo/Bev. Blood samples were collected before and 3 weeks after treatment, and tumor response was assessed using contrast-enhanced computed tomography 6 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Significant changes in serum IL-6 levels were observed in patients treated with Atezo/Bev as first-line therapy but not in those treated with it as second line or later-line therapy. In patients treated with Atezo/Bev as first-line therapy, serum IL-6 levels increased significantly after treatment in patients with a complete or partial response but not in patients with stable or progressive disease. Furthermore, compared to other tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein, lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein, and des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin, serum IL-6 levels exhibited the highest sensitivity in predicting tumor response during the treatment period. CONCLUSION: In patients with uHCC treated with Atezo/Bev, serum IL-6 levels could serve as a potential predictor of tumor response. Elevated levels after treatment may indicate a favorable tumor response and prognosis.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

METHODS: An interventional trial was conducted to compare frequency of treatment and visual acuity for the neovascular age-related macular degeneration patients before and during use of home optical coherence tomography over a period of 6 months. Patient adherence to regular scanning was measured by the number of scans performed per week. The characteristics of episodes of fluid recurrence and classification of typical fluid volume trajectories were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-seven eyes (21 with diagnosis of neovascular age-related macular degeneration and one converted during the study), of 15 patients were monitored for 6 months, scanning at 6.2 times/week per eye and yielding 4,435 scans of which 91.2% were eligible for artificial intelligence-based fluid volume quantification. Total number of monitoring weeks before and during the study were 1,555 and 509. The mean (SD) number of weeks per injection before and during home OCT management were 8.0 (4.7) and 15.3 (8.5) (P = 0.004), respectively. The mean (SD) visual acuity change before and during home OCT-based management was 3.5 (12.0) letters and 0.0 (9.5) letters (P = 0.45), respectively, showing no significant impact on visual acuity. CONCLUSION: For the first time, remote patient monitoring with a home OCT allowed personalized management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

HCC is the most common form of liver cancer, accounting for approximately 90% of all cases worldwide. Moreover, apart from the current pharmacological interventions, hepatic resection and liver transplantation are the mainstay curative approaches for patients with HCC. This systematic review included phase I, II, III, and IV clinical trials (CTs) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on current treatments for patients with HCC in Asian populations (2013-2023). A total of 427 articles were screened, and 184 non-duplicate publications were identified. After screening the titles and abstracts, 96 publications were excluded, and another 28 were excluded after full-text screening. The remaining 60 eligible RCTs/CTs were finally included. A total of 60 clinical trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria with 36 drugs used as monotherapy or combination therapy for HCC. Most studies used sorafenib alone or in combination with any of the treatment regimens. Lenvatinib or atezolizumab with bevacizumab was used for HCC after initial sorafenib treatment. Eighteen studies compared the efficacy of sorafenib with that of other drugs, including lenvatinib, cabozantinib, tepotinib, tigatuzumab, linifanib, erlotinib, resminostat, brivanib, tislelizumab, selumetinib, and refametinib. This study provides comprehensive insights into effective treatment interventions for HCC in Asian populations. The overall assessment indicates that sorafenib, used alone or in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, has been the first treatment choice in the past decade to achieve better outcomes in patients with HCC in Asian populations.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

Atezolizumab, an anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), in combination with bevacizumab, has substantially improved outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes in patients who develop infections while receiving atezolizumab and bevacizumab for uHCC. Methods: Patients who received atezolizumab and bevacizumab for uHCC at a single hospital network were included. Types and rates of infections were reported. Covariates compared among infected and non-infected cohorts included age, sex, race, comorbidities, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, immunosuppressive use, chronic infections, number of cycles of ICIs given, antibiotic or antiviral therapies at ICI initiation, and line of therapy (first-line, second-line, greater than second-line). Results: Out of 810 evaluable patients, 34 uHCC patients were treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. The mean ± SD age was 66.29 ± 9.39; 28 (82.35%) were males. There were 17 (50%) patients with reported infection, with bacterial infection occurring in 12 (70.59%) patients and COVID-19 in 4 (23.5%). Of the infected patients, eight (47.06%) had one infection, five (29.41%) had two infections, and two (11.76%) had three or more infections. Infected and non-infected patients received a median of 12 (IQR: 5-17) and 4 (IQR: 3-12) ICI cycles (p = 0.18), respectively. Infections did not negatively impact OS or PFS but resulted in treatment delays and discontinuation in 11 (64.71%) and 7 (41.18%) patients, respectively. At the last follow-up, 19 (55.88%) patients died, 9 (52.94%) in the non-infected group vs. 10 (58.82%) in the infected group (p = 1.0). Conclusions: While a broad array of infections occurred in 50% of the patients in this cohort, it did not negatively impact survival outcomes. However, it did impact morbidity, with more all-cause admissions and treatment delays.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

We report a patient with concomitant GBM, Mg, and dAVF who was treated with neoadjuvant Bev, resulting in a reduction in the volume of GBM along with an improvement of clinical symptoms. An 85-year-old male presented with aphasia, gait disturbance, and dementia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a ring-enhanced intra-axial tumor with perifocal edema in the left temporal lobe, a dura-attached extra-axial tumor at the left sphenoid ridge, and dAVF at the left transverse-sigmoid sinus. Due to the age of the patient and low Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score, pharmacotherapy with a single dose of Bev was chosen over surgical resection. Three days after the Bev administration, aphasia and gait disturbance had dramatically improved. Volume reduction rates at one and five months after three administrations of Bev were 0.34% and 95.9% for GBM and 13.7% and 6.8% for meningioma, respectively. No significant change in dAVF was seen on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) during Bev therapy. VEGF concentration in GBM is known to be the highest among all types of brain tumors, including meningioma. VEGF might not play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of dAVF. Based on this evidence from the present rare case with concomitant GBM, meningioma, and dAVF, responsiveness to Bev might depend on the level of VEGF expression.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

Here we investigate these contributions by combining engineered materials, proteomics, analysis of patient data, and a model of bevacizumab-resistant GBM. We find that GBM cells cultured in engineered 3D hyaluronic acid hydrogels secrete ECM prior to invasion, particularly in the absence of exogenous ECM ligands. Proteomic measurements reveal extensive secretion of collagen VI, and collagen VI-associated transcripts are correspondingly enriched in microvascular proliferation regions of human GBMs. We further show that bevacizumab-resistant GBM cells deposit more collagen VI than their responsive counterparts, which is associated with marked cell-ECM stiffening. COL6A3 deletion in GBM cells reduces invasion, ß-catenin signaling, and expression of mesenchymal markers, and these effects are amplified in hypoxia. Our studies strongly implicate GBM cell-derived collagen VI in microenvironmental remodeling to facilitate invasion.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

The controversies have resulted in the perception that many clinicians are apprehensive about prescribing these medications to their patient populations. There also remains widespread uncertainty as to the economic impact, cost benefit ratio, and safety oversight for use of these medications in standard clinical care settings. Methods: To contextualize such issues, the present study compared anti-amyloid biologic therapy (lecanemab) to four commonly used biologic agents in other fields, including trastuzumab for breast cancer, bevacizumab for lung cancer, etanercept for rheumatoid arthritis, and ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis. Results: The data presented demonstrate comparable costs, clinical benefits, and risks for these biologic agents in their disparate disease states. Discussion: These results provide context for the costs, clinical benefits, and safety regarding the mainstream use of anti-amyloid biologic agents for the prevention of cognitive loss. While the era of disease-modifying therapies for AD is now in its infancy, there is an expectation that these discoveries will be followed by improved therapies and combination treatments leading to greater efficacy in ameliorating the clinical trajectory of AD. Highlights: Anti-amyloid therapy costs are comparable to other commonly used biologics.Anti-amyloid therapy efficacy is comparable to other commonly used biologics.Anti-amyloid therapy safety is compatible with other commonly used biologics.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

However, real-world data are limited for patients who receive niraparib-bevacizumab first-line maintenance therapy. The COMB1NE study describes real-world clinical outcomes (time to treatment discontinuation; time to next treatment) in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer who received niraparib-bevacizumab first-line maintenance, regardless of first-line bevacizumab use. METHODS: This real-world, retrospective study used a US nationwide electronic health record-derived deidentified database. Eligible patients were 18 years or older at initial epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis and initiated niraparib-bevacizumab first-line maintenance (January 1, 2017-September 2, 2022) following first-line treatment. The index date was the start of first-line maintenance. Patients were followed until death, last clinical activity, or end of study, whichever occurred first. Time to treatment discontinuation and time to next treatment, a proxy for real-world progression-free survival, were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Among 59 included patients, the median age was 67 years (interquartile range (IQR) 61-76), and 81.4% had stage III/IV epithelial ovarian cancer at diagnosis. Overall, 83.1% of patients had BRCA wild-type with either HRp or HR status unknown disease. Median time to treatment discontinuation of first-line maintenance was 11.8 months (95% CI 8.7 to 13.5). Median time to next treatment was 14.1 months (95% CI 11.3 to 16.6). At 6 months after index, 77.9% of patients had not initiated second-line treatment; at 12 months, 61.3% had not. CONCLUSION: In this real-world study of patients receiving niraparib-bevacizumab first-line maintenance, the majority of whom had HRp/HR status unknown, the median time to next treatment was consistent with observed progression-free survival in patients with similar HR status in the OVARIO study.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

mdl-39268278,https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-39268278,Factors Affecting Compliance and Visual Outcomes in Patients Receiving Intravitreal Bevacizumab Injections.,"Background Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a powerful mitogen for endothelial cells that promotes migration, proliferation, and tube formation necessary for the angiogenic development of new blood vessels. When VEGF increases significantly, it causes pathological angiogenesis and increased vascular permeability in eye conditions such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). These disorders have become important global sources of morbidity and have a substantial financial impact not only on the medical community but also on the patients. Therefore, this study aims to determine the success rates of intravitreal bevacizumab therapy and the visual outcomes which may be increased by determining the factors affecting patient compliance and raising awareness about DR, neovascular AMD, and RVO among patients and studying the factors responsible for non-compliance to treatment. Methodology This experimental pre-post study was conducted in the ophthalmology department at a tertiary care hospital and research center in western Maharashtra from September 2022 to June 2024. A total of 150 eyes of 150 patients who were diagnosed cases of DR, neovascular AMD, and non-ischemic RVO were included in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Data were entered in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) and statistical analysis was done using SPSS 27.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The chi-square test was employed to check the association between categorical variables. Pearson's correlation test was used, and p-values <0.05 were considered significant. Results The compliance rate in our study was 79.3% (113 individuals). In our study, 58% (87 individuals) were male while 42% (63 individuals) were females. Most patients were from urban areas 74.7% (112 individuals). Among the study participants, DR patients constituted 48.6% (73 individuals), while neovascular AMD and RVO were seen in 32% (48 individuals) and 19.4% (29 individuals), with 62% (93 individuals) being diabetic and 64.7% (97 individuals) being hypertensive. In our study, 92% (138 individuals) were willing to take treatment, with 88.7% (133 individuals) worried about their visual outcomes and 66% (99 individuals) afraid of getting injected. Appointments posed a financial burden to 30.7% (46 individuals) of patients, with 55.3% (83 individuals) having transportation issues. Overall, 18.7% (28 individuals) of patients had missed appointments between 14 and 90 days while 30.7% (46 individuals) had missed their appointments by 90 and 365 days. Younger patients with a shorter duration of diabetes had higher compliance rates. Post-injection, there was an overall significant improvement in vision as well as a reduction in the central subfield macular thickness, volume cube, and thickness average cube. Conclusions In the present study, four-fifths of the patients were compliant with treatment, and visual improvement was significant. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the macular thickness after the treatment. One of the factors for non-compliance included in our study was the need for follow-up. Younger patients and those with a shorter duration of diabetes had significantly higher compliance. We recommend further studies should be conducted to compare the effectiveness with the control group in randomized control trials.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

METHODS: Retrospective data analysis of the PROOF study, a multi-center real-world retrospective chart review conducted across Korea in patients with nAMD included treatment-naive patients with nAMD who received first anti-VEGF (ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or aflibercept) between January 2017 and March 2019 was performed. All 600 patients (cohort 1) had a minimum follow-up of 12 months of which 453 patients (cohort 2) were followed-up for 24 months from baseline. RESULTS: At month 12 after anti-VEGF therapy, 58.10% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 54.09, 62.12) of patients and at month 24, 66.02% of patients continued to have persistent retinal fluid. At both months 12 and 24, predictive factors for persistent disease activity were fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachments (PED) (P = 0.0494) and retinal fluid at month 3 after loading phase (P = 0.0082). The mean changes in visual acuity were + 6.2, + 10.1, and + 13.3 letters and in the central subfield thickness were - 79.1 µm, - 96.3 µm, and - 134.4 µm at 12 months from baseline, in the bevacizumab, aflibercept, and ranibizumab groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of retinal fluid after loading phase and fibrovascular PED were predictors of persistent disease activity after at least 1 year of anti-VEGF treatment.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

This study was aimed at comparing the survival of patients with recurrent glioblastoma receiving bevacizumab monotherapy and those receiving bevacizumab plus irinotecan combination therapy (B+I) by using a nationwide population-based dataset. METHODS: Patients matching the International Classification of Diseases code C71.x were screened from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database. From January 2008 to November 2021, patients who underwent surgery or biopsy and subsequent standard concurrent chemoradiation with temozolomide were included. Among them, those who received bevacizumab monotherapy or B+I were selected. Demographic characteristics, inpatient stay, prescription frequency, survival outcomes, and steroid prescription duration were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: Eight hundred and forty-six patients who underwent surgery or biopsy and received concurrent chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide were included. Of these, 450 and 396 received bevacizumab monotherapy and B+I, respectively. The corresponding median overall survival from the initial surgery was 22.60 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.50-24.21) and 20.44 months (95% CI, 18.55-22.60; P = 0.508, log-rank test). The B+I group had significantly more bevacizumab prescriptions (median 5 times; BEV group: median 3 times). Cox analysis, based on the postsurgery period, revealed that male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; P = 0.002), older age (HR, 1.01; P = 0.042), and undergoing biopsy instead of surgery (HR, 1.79; P < 0.0001) were significantly associated with decreased survival. Fewer radiotherapy cycles correlated with improved survival outcomes (HR, 0.63; P = 0.001). Cox analysis, conducted from the start of chemotherapy including bevacizumab, showed that male sex was the only variable significantly associated with decreased survival (HR, 1.18; P = 0.044). CONCLUSION: We found no significant difference in overall survival between the bevacizumab monotherapy and B+I groups. Considering the additional potential toxicity associated with irinotecan, bevacizumab monotherapy could be a suitable treatment option for treating recurrent glioblastoma.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02
mdl-39279952,https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-39279952,Spontaneous regression of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma following COVID-19 infection and vaccination: a case report and review of literature.,"Background: Spontaneous regression (SR) of cancer remains a rare phenomenon, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where limited literature exists. This case report emphasizes the significance of SR in advanced HCC, shedding light on the proposed mechanisms and addressing the scarcity of documented cases in current medical literature. Case Description: We present the case of a 67-year-old female with a history of localized HCC who underwent right hepatectomy. Surveillance imaging 4 months later revealed tumor recurrence with tumor thrombus in the main portal vein. Radioembolization was deemed unsuitable, leading to the recommendation of systemic therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab. Prior to receiving any treatment, the patient tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), having previously received both the messenger RNA (mRNA)-1273 vaccine series and a booster. Surprisingly, subsequent imaging 10 months after initial diagnosis showed SR of the previously identified lesions, suggesting a potential link between viral exposure, vaccination, and the observed regression. The patient eventually received treatment with atezolizumab and bevacizumab and has sustained disease control to date, 12 months after initiating treatment. Conclusions: This unique case highlights SR of advanced HCC following COVID-19 infection, raising intriguing questions about the interplay between viral infections, vaccinations, and cancer outcomes. The patient's response in the absence of systemic therapy further underscores the complexity of HCC management and prompts further investigation into the potential immunomodulatory effects of viral infections and vaccinations on cancer regression. Understanding these interactions could have implications for tailoring treatment approaches and improving outcomes in patients with advanced HCC.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02
mdl-39250830,https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-39250830,KEAP1-mutant atypical meningioma: illustrative case.,"BACKGROUND: While genetic testing of tumors is commonly used to inform the selection of systemic therapies, there is limited evidence for the application of radiotherapy for brain cancer. Recent studies have shown that Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), a key regulator of cellular responses to oxidative and electrophilic stress, is associated with radioresistance in multiple cancer types. Several studies have reported the clinical significance of KEAP1 mutation in brain metastasis; however, the effect of KEAP1 mutations on radioresponse in meningioma has never been reported. OBSERVATIONS: The authors present the case of a 40-year-old female with a KEAP1 mutation-positive atypical meningioma that was initially treated with resection followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Recurrence was observed at 15 months, requiring reoperation and adjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). An excellent treatment response was observed at 7 months post-SRS with an improvement in reported symptoms, although bevacizumab was required for the resolution of radiation necrosis observed 2 months post-SRS. LESSONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of KEAP1-mutant meningioma, including its clinical course after comprehensive management. Notably, treatment included multimodal radiotherapy with IMRT followed by SRS. SRS led to an excellent treatment response at the 7-month follow-up. However, radiation necrosis developed after both radiotherapy treatments, suggesting that radiological modification can be beneficial in patients with KEAP1 mutations. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24387.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

Blurry vision, caused by the choroidal metastasis, improved with first-line treatment with afatinib. Thereafter, osimertinib was administered as a second-line treatment, then chemotherapy containing pemetrexed plus bevacizumab as a third-line treatment. For 61 months, recurrence of choroidal metastasis was absent. Only a few reports of lung cancer with choroidal metastasis provide long-term follow-up of more than five years. Therefore, the clinical course of this patient may provide some insights for long-term management in such cases.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02

The aim of the prospective IVOPAK II study was to implement an interdisciplinary guideline-conform personalized CRC palliative therapy of metastatic colorectal carcinoma and to improve the overall survival (OS) by multidisciplinary approach via secondary metastatic resection. We present the efficacy data of first-line treatment and the benefit of interdisciplinary collaboration of right-sided metastatic colon carcinoma patients: n â=â25. RAS mutation: n â=â20 (80%): received systemic first-line treatment: FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. All-RAS-wildtype: n â=â5 (20%): received systemic first-line treatment: FOLFIRI plus cetuximab. Last date evaluation: 31 January 2024. Median age: 59.6âyears (range 42-71), men/women: 14/11. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) index: 0/1/2â:â11/10/4. Evaluable for response: n â=â25. Complete response: n â=â0, partial response: n â=â14 (56%), stable disease: n â=â8 (32%), progressive disease: n â=â3 (12%), early tumor shrinkage: n â=â13 (52%), estimates progression-free survival: 13âmonths (95% CI 8-17âmonths), estimated OS: 48âmonths (95% CI 25-71âmonths), median follow-up: 26âmonths (1-61âmonths), no evidence of disease: n â=â4 (16%). A chemotherapy doublette regimen with FOLFIRI plus a biological as first-line treatment shows promising efficacy and secondary metastatic resection after interdisciplinary discussion was associated with a survival benefit in right-sided metastatic colon carcinoma.","","",ELEA,Argentina,BEVAX,2024-09-02
