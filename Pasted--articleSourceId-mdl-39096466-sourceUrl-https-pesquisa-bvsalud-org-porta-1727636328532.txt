    "title": "Pharmacological Treatment of Binge Eating Disorder and Frequent Comorbid Diseases.",
    "englishAbstract": "Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common specific eating disorder (ED). It is frequently associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, bipolar disorder (BD), anxiety disorders, alcohol and nicotine use disorder, and obesity. The aim of this narrative review was to summarize the evidence for the pharmacological treatment of BED and its comorbid disorders. We recommend the ADHD medication lisdexamfetamine (LDX) and the antiepileptic and antimigraine drug topiramate for the pharmacological treatment of BED. However, only LDX is approved for the treatment of BED in some countries. Medications to treat diseases frequently comorbid with BED include atomoxetine and LDX for ADHD; citalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, and venlafaxine for anxiety disorders and depression; aripiprazole for manic episodes of BD; lamotrigine, lirasidone and lumateperone for depressive episodes of BD; naltrexone for alcohol use disorder; bupropion for nicotine use disorder; and liraglutide, semaglutide, and the combination of bupropion and naltrexone for obesity. As obesity is a frequent health consequence of BED, weight gain-inducing medications, such as the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine or clozapine, the novel antidepressant mirtazapine and tricyclic antidepressants, and the mood stabilizer valproate should be avoided where possible. It is currently unclear whether the novel and promising glucagon, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists like tirzepatide and retatrutide help with BED and its comorbidities. However, these compounds have been reported to reduce binge eating in individuals with obesity or overweight.",

    "title": "The cost-effectiveness of semaglutide in reducing cardiovascular risk among people with overweight and obesity and existing cardiovascular disease, but without diabetes.",
    "englishAbstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Semaglutide Effects on Cardiovascular Outcomes in People with Overweight or Obesity (SELECT) trial demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular outcomes in people with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and overweight or obesity (but without diabetes). However, the cost of the medication has raised concerns about its financial viability and accessibility within healthcare systems. This study explored whether use of semaglutide for the secondary prevention of CVD in overweight or obesity is cost-effective from the Australian healthcare perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed based on the SELECT trial to model the clinical outcomes and costs of a hypothetical population treated with semaglutide versus placebo, in addition to standard care, and followed up over 20 years. With each annual cycle, subjects were at risk of having non-fatal CVD events or dying. Model inputs were derived from SELECT and published literature. Costs were obtained from Australian sources. All outcomes were discounted by 5% annually. The main outcome of interest was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of cost per year of life saved (YoLS) and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: With an annual estimated cost of semaglutide of A${\\$}$4175, the model resulted in ICERs of A${\\$}$99�853 (US${\\$}$143�504; �40�873) per YoLS and A${\\$}$96�055 (US${\\$}$138�046; �39�318) per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of A${\\$}$50�000, semaglutide is not considered cost-effective at the current price. A price of�=�A${\\$}$2000 per year or more targeted use in high-risk patients would be needed for it to be considered cost-effective in the Australian setting.",
